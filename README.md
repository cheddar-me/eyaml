# eyaml

`eyaml` is a tool for asymmetric encryption of YAML and JSON files. It's largely based on [`ejson`](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson) and backwards compatible with any `*.ejson` file.

Assymetric encryption is handled by [RubyCrypto/rbnacl](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/rbnacl/wiki) using a [sealed box](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/rbnacl/wiki/Public-Key-Encryption).

## Installation

To install `eyaml`, run:

```shell
gem install eyaml
```

Or alternatively, you can add it to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'eyaml'
```

### Dependencies

`eyaml` depends on [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium). At least `1.0.0` is required.

For MacOS users, libsodium is available via homebrew and can be installed with:
```shell
brew install libsodium
```

## Usage

`eyaml` requires that a file has a `_public_key` attribute that corresponds to the value generated by running `eyaml keygen`. Adding a plaintext value into the file and running `eyaml encrypt secrets.eyaml` (for a file called `secrets.eyaml`) will encrypt the value using the public key in the same file. To decrypt, ensure a private key is accessible and run `eyaml decrypt secrets.eyaml`

`eyaml` supports both JSON and YAML with the extensions `eyaml`, `eyml`, and `ejson`. It will using the extension to determine the format of its output.

### CLI

`eyaml` is primarily interacted through its CLI.

```
-> % eyaml help
Commands:
  eyaml decrypt         # Decrypt an EYAML file
  eyaml encrypt         # (Re-)encrypt one or more EYAML files
  eyaml help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  eyaml keygen          # Generate a new EYAML keypair

Options:
  -k, [--keydir=KEYDIR]  # Directory containing EYAML keys
```

#### `eyaml encrypt`

(Re-)encrypt one or more EYAML files. This is used whenever you add a new value to the config file.

```shell
-> % eyaml encrypt config/secrets.production.eyaml
Wrote 517 bytes to config/secrets.production.eyaml.

Note: entries starting with an `_` won't be encrypted. This has to be the case for the `_public_key`, but can be handy if you want to add keys in there that you dont't want to encrypt. Like a public key for ex.
```

#### `eyaml decrypt`

Decrypts the whole provided EYAML file.

```shell
-> % eyaml decrypt config/secrets.production.eyaml
_public_key: d1c7ba73c520445c5ba14984da8119f2f7b8df7bcdb3f37f5afe9613b118936a
secret: password
```

#### `eyaml keygen`

Generates the keypair for the encryption flow to work. The public key must be placed into the file at `_public_key` like this:
e.g.
```shell
-> % cat config/credentials.development.eyaml
_public_key: a3dbdef9efd1e52a34588de56a6cf9b03bbc2aaf0edda145cfbd9a6370a0a849
my_secret: 85d1fca99d98c4e7b83b868f75f809e1e33346317b0c354b593cdcdc8793ad4e
```

The private key must be saved in the default key directory (`/opt/ejson/keys`) or the `EJSON_PRIVATE_KEY` must point to the right directory, with the filename being the public key and the contents, the private key, a key directory you'll provide later, or just pass the `--write` flag for `eyaml` to handle it for you.

```shell
-> % eyaml keygen
Public Key: a3dbdef9efd1e52a34588de56a6cf9b03bbc2aaf0edda145cfbd9a6370a0a849
Private Key: b01592942ba10f152bcf7c6b6734f6392554c578ff24cebcc62f9e3da6fcf302

# Or by using the --write flag

-> % eyaml keygen --write
Public Key: a3dbdef9efd1e52a34588de56a6cf9b03bbc2aaf0edda145cfbd9a6370a0a849

-> % cat /opt/ejson/keys/a3dbdef9efd1e52a34588de56a6cf9b03bbc2aaf0edda145cfbd9a6370a0a849
b01592942ba10f152bcf7c6b6734f6392554c578ff24cebcc62f9e3da6fcf302
```

### Rails

`eyaml` comes with baked in Rails support.
It will search for a rails secrets or credentials file in `config/`, decrypt, and load the first valid one it finds.

For this a public-private keyfile needs to be present, which you can generate with `eyaml keygen`. For a development/test environment you can keep this in your
version control, but on production you want to take the proper precautions since this can contain your rails master key as well.

Credential files have priority over secrets before rails 7.2:
`credentials.{eyaml|eyml|ejson}` (e.g. `config/credentials.eyaml`) then `credentials.$env.{eyaml|eyml|ejson}` (e.g. `credentials.production.eyml`).
Then if no credentials are found it will look for a secrets file:
`secrets.{eyaml|eyml|ejson}` (e.g. `config/secrets.eyaml`) then `secrets.$env.{eyaml|eyml|ejson}` (e.g. `secrets.production.eyml`).

Note: From rails 7.2 onwards secrets are deprecated and eyaml will only look for credential files.

Instead of needing a private key locally, you can provide it to EYAML by setting `EJSON_PRIVATE_KEY` and it'll be automatically used for decrypting the secrets file.

If you put your rails master key encrypted in the eyaml file, make sure you don't have another `master.key` file somewhere, since that can interfere.

### Example setup

To add encryption + credentials to a rails project do the following things:

- Generate a private-public keypair with (or add the --write flag and a keypair file will be written to `/opt/ejson/keys/`):
  ```shell
  eyaml keygen

  Public Key: a3dbdef9efd1e52a34588de56a6cf9b03bbc2aaf0edda145cfbd9a6370a0a849
  Private Key: b01592942ba10f152bcf7c6b6734f6392554c578ff24cebcc62f9e3da6fcf302
  ```

  For this example I show you a dev setup, but for test, production etc. it works the same.

- Create a file with the name of the public key that contains the private key.
  If you don't want to add the file to the `/opt/ejson/keys/` (for for example a dev/test environment) so you can check it in with your version management you can set the `EJSON_KEYDIR` to the keypair file
  in rails `application.rb` like so:
  ```ruby
  ENV["EJSON_KEYDIR"] = File.expand_path("../dev/ejson-keys", __dir__) unless Rails.env.production?
  ```
  and rails will look there for the file decryption when the environment loads.
  You can test this by calling
  ```ruby
  Rails.application.credentials.secret_key_base
  ```
  in a rails console and it should give you back the unencrypted key.

  Note that you should not have a `config/master.key` file present (created by rails when using it's credentials management like for ex when calling `rails credentials:edit`) when using eyaml.
  Eyaml is a replacement for rails's credentials management and currently conflicts with it. Eyaml will raise when a master.key is present.

- Create a `config/credentials.development.eyaml` file
- In the credentials file add:
  ```yaml
  _public_key: a3dbdef9efd1e52a34588de56a6cf9b03bbc2aaf0edda145cfbd9a6370a0a849
  ```
  on top
- You can then add your rails `secret_key_base` like so:
  ```yaml
  secret_key_base: <secret>
  ```
  And any other key you need in there.
- Then every time you edit your eyaml file(s) run (for ex for development):
  ```shell
  eyaml encrypt config/credentials.development.eyaml
  ```
  And you can see that the key put in there is encrypted afterwards (except the ones starting with an `_`).

### Apple M1 Support

If you're using the new Apple M1, you need to ensure that you're using a `ffi` that is working. We've temporarily been including a fork with a fix in any `Gemfile` where we've included `eyaml`:

```ruby
gem "ffi", github: "cheddar-me/ffi", branch: "apple-m1", submodules: true
```

### Underscored vs de-underscored

Keys that start with an underscore are treated as-is and are assumed unencrypted in the secrets/credentials files.
To make our lives a little easier in calling them in the application they are callable without the underscore. So a `_secret` can be called with

```ruby
Rails.application.credentials.secret
```
and
```ruby
Rails.application.credentials._secret
```

To prevent conflicts with having the same name underscored and not, we don't allow that and the gem will raise an exception.
This makes sense since we believe it could be a security hazard to have an encrypted key also unencrypted. The best solution is to give either a different name to make the intention clear.

## Development

To get started, make sure you have a working version of Ruby locally. Then clone the repo, and run `bin/setup` (this will install `libsodium` if you're on a Mac and setup bundler). Running `bundle exec rake` or `bundle exec rake spec` will run the test suite.
